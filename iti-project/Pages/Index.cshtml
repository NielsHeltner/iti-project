    <h4>So now you probably think: "Why this website?"</h4>
    <p>Great question!</p><br />
    <p>This was the exact question Daniel Radcliffe was asked, when we presented him the website.</p><br />
    <p>Daniel reacted immediately with: </p>
    <div class="quotation-block">
        <q>This page is ******* ****, was it seriously necessary to kidnap my parents, and then force me to see this?! </q>
    </div><br /><br />
    <p>As it can be seen on our picture we took of him, his reaction was overwhelmingly positive!</p>
    <p>Of course we never think this webpage will be perfect, but it is very close.</p>
    <p>Many many many hours have been put into this webpage, this includes spelll checking and inserting<br />interesting pictures, that shows our passion for this website.</p>
    <p>We asked Daniel, since we had him as visitor, about how we could make the page even better. <br />Then he putted some weird glasses on, took out a wand he had in his pocket and shouted:</p>
    <div class="quotation-block">
        <q>WEBPAGUS DELETUS!</q>
    </div><br /><br />
    <p>... What an exciting visitor!</p><br />
    <p>Please feel free to explore this fantastic webpage, and sign up for our adventurous newsletter!<br />or go to the administration page, and change some information, because that is a very<br />important feature to have on a webpage..</p><br />
